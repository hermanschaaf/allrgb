Go AllRGB Painting Generator
============================

 > Look mom, I made art!

This Go program generates images that use every color in the RGB color palette exactly once, and tries to do so in as easthetically-pleasing way as possible.

There are different modes. 

#### Tie-dye

```
go run tiedye.go
```

#### Flower

```
go run flower.go
```

#### Pointillist

```
go run pointillist.go
```
